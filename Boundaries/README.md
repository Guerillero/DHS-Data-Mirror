# Boundaries

In each folder are ZIP files containing the boundary data that you would have been able to get from SDR. Not every geographical extent is known, especially for older surveys. Please consult with the report for more information.

From https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/methodology/:

> Since 1984, The DHS Program has provided technical assistance to more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries, advancing global understanding of health and population trends in developing countries. DHS has earned a worldwide reputation for collecting and disseminating accurate, nationally representative data on fertility, family planning, maternal and child health, gender, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and nutrition. The information is processed and presented in reports and data formats that describe the situation of the relevant country. Details on The DHS Program standard procedures, methodologies, and manuals can be found here.

>
> - A shapefile for use in a GIS. Each shapefile is made up of 7 files containing the following extensions: .dbf, .prj, .sbn, .sbx, .shp, .shp.xml, .shx
> - An explanatory notes file containing citation and data use guidelines
> - A data availablility file containing a chart of data available for the indicators and surveys selected during the download process

> ## Subnational Boundaries
>
> GIS data are provided "as is" and boundary representations are not necessarily authoritative. The national and subnational geometry in the downloadable shapefiles comes from the following sources:
>
> - National boundaries come from The U.S. Department of State's Office of the Geographer (INR/GGI) - Small Scale International Boundaries (SSIB), Updated December 2011
> - Subnational boundaries come from a variety of sources including the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM), The Second Administrative Level Boundaries data set project (SALB), and National Agencies of Statistics. To view additional information about subnational boundaries for a particular country or survey, refer to the Boundaries page.
