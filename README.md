# DHS Spatial Data Mirror

The included files and information were sourced from The DHS Program website, https://dhsprogram.com, or the Spatial Data Repository, https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com. They are presented here as a backup in case the website or its data is removed without a public archive due to the shuttering of The DHS Program. It is my hope that having access to these will improve the efforts of future public health, demography, and economic researchers. If I missed any data, please either add it via a pull request or request it via an issue.
