# Geospatial Covariates

Each folder contains ZIP files with geospatial covariate data that you would have downloaded from the Spatial Data Repository. To simplify searching, the ZIP files have been renamed using the format `<country> <year> <type>`, rather than the standard 8-character recode format (e.g., `ZWGC72FL`). The CSV files inside the ZIPs retain their original file names.

It seems that the extractions include a mix of second and third edition data. Unfortunately, the version code (the 6th character in the filename) does not distinguish between the two editions. Please review the included PDF carefuly before using.

All three versions of the manual are included in this repo.

## Background

From https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/covariates/ :

> The geospatial covariate datasets link survey cluster locations to ancillary data - known as covariates – that contain data on topics including population, climate, and environmental factors. This allows individuals with limited Geographic Information Systems (GIS) experience to conduct geospatial statistical analysis without having to manually source and link these covariates to cluster locations. These covariates are extracted from freely available global datasets. The covariates are packaged as a zip and include a .csv data file and a data description PDF file that defines each of the included covariates. See the included documentation PDF for more information about how the data was extracted and the sources that were used. For information about earlier covariate dataset releases, see the First Edition or Second Edition of the documentation. Geospatial coordinates are also available, along with harmonized DHS variables, through IPUMS DHS, a free data dissemination tool housed at the University of Minnesota and funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. IPUMS DHS is an ideal tool for users wishing to conduct analyses that pool multiple DHS datasets. The IPUMS DHS Climate Change and Health (CCH) Research Hub provides researchers with guidance on how to conduct rigorous CCH studies with IPUMS DHS and contextual data.
