# Geospatial Covariates

Hereâ€™s an improved version of your text:

Each folder contains ZIP files with geospatial covariate data that you would have typically obtained from SDR. To simplify searching, the ZIP files have been renamed using the format `<country> <year> <type>`, rather than the standard 8-character recode format (e.g., `ZWGC72FL`). The CSV files inside the ZIPs retain their original file names.

It seems that the extractions include a mix of second and third edition data. Unfortunately, the version code (the 6th character in the filename) does not distinguish between the two editions. Please review the included PDF carefuly.

All three versions of the manual are included in this repo.
